            <p>Bangladesh has been hit with the worst flooding in 100 years. Thousands of children are at risk,
                threatened
                by a high risk of drowning, disease, and malnutrition. More than 36,000 children are crowded into
                emergency
                flood shelters. Families and children are trapped at home waiting for boats to bring relief. Roads and
                homes
                have been submerged, power stations are down, and over 380 schools have been closed or impacted. </p>

            <p>They are waiting desperately for food and shelter. But surprisingly, the government does not seem to have
                an efficient relief management plan for the victims. We have seen in the media that there is a shortage
                of relief, <br> especially baby food, in the affected areas, which should not have been the case. We
                have seen how the local government officials are seeking assistance from people.
